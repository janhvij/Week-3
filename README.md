## Overview

The third week was dedicated to understanding fundamental data structures and algorithmic techniques using Java. We started with the concept of linked lists and progressed to more abstract data structures like stacks, queues, and hash-based structures. We then explored basic sorting and searching algorithms, delved into binary search and its variants, and finally discussed how to analyze code efficiency using time complexity.
